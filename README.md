This task involves building an interactive Tableau dashboard tailored for executive decision-making. The dashboard must integrate data from one provided dataset and one external, public dataset, featuring four diverse visualizations to summarize data or show trends. It includes two interactive controls to modify data presentation and two calculated metrics or KPIs combining both datasets. Additionally, provide the data files, step-by-step installation instructions, and a guide to navigating the dashboard. The dashboard must be saved as a .twbx file and designed to accommodate users with colorblindness.
